          This Master Services Agreement (“Agreement”) is entered into by zrzastudio.com, Inc. (“zrzastudio.com”), a
          Delaware corporation and the entity listed as the customer on the applicable Order Form (“Customer”) as of the
          Effective Date (as defined below), with zrzastudio.com and Customer sometimes referred to individually as a
          “Party” and collectively as the “Parties,”. This Agreement will be effective on the date Customer enters into
          an Order Form or other ordering document referencing this Agreement (the “Effective Date”).

          For good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the Parties
          agree as follows:
          1. Provision of Services

          Provision of Service and Access Credentials. zrzastudio.com will make the Services available to Customer
          pursuant to this Agreement and all Order Forms during the Term. Access to the Services may be provided to
          Customer based on the number of Users, or some other metric, as specified in the applicable Order Form. All
          access and use of the Services by Users will be through a third-party identity provider that is compatible
          with the Services. Customer is responsible for the provisioning, use, and configuration of the third-party
          identity provider.
          Customer Affiliates. Customer may also permit its Affiliates and their employees and contractors working for
          the benefit of Customer or such Affiliates to serve as Users, provided Customer remains responsible for
          compliance by such individuals with all the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Alternatively, Customer
          Affiliates may purchase Subscriptions and Professional Services by executing Order Forms or Statements of Work
          hereunder that references the terms of this Agreement, and in each such case, all references in this Agreement
          to Customer will be deemed to refer to such Customer Affiliate for purposes of such Order or Statements of
          Work and such Affiliates will be responsible for their compliance with the terms of this Agreement.
          Service Levels and Support Services. zrzastudio.com will use commercially reasonable efforts to make the
          Services available in accordance with the service levels set out in Exhibit A. zrzastudio.com will also
          provide Support Services to Customer in accordance with zrzastudio.com’s service support schedule set out in
          Exhibit A.

          2. Responsibilities

          Customer Responsibilities. Customer is responsible and liable for: (a) all access to and use of the Services
          and zrzastudio.com Materials directly or indirectly by or through the Customer Systems or its or its Users’
          Access Credentials; (b) the accuracy, quality, integrity, legality, reliability and appropriateness of all
          Customer Data; (c) using commercially reasonable efforts to prevent unauthorized access to, or use of, the
          Services and Users’ Access Credentials, and notifying zrzastudio.com promptly of any such unauthorized access
          or use; (d) complying with all applicable laws in using the Services.
          Customer Systems. Customer’s right to use Customer Systems is governed by the terms and conditions established
          by each Customer Systems’ provider with Customer directly.
          Remedies. zrzastudio.com may temporarily suspend Customer’s (including Users’) access to the Services if
          zrzastudio.com reasonably determines that: (i) there is, or there is reasonably likely to be, a threat on the
          zrzastudio.com Materials caused by Customer; (ii) Customer’s use of the zrzastudio.com Materials disrupts or
          poses a security risk to the zrzastudio.com Materials or to any other customer or vendor of zrzastudio.com;
          (iii) Customer, or any User, is using the zrzastudio.com Materials for fraudulent or illegal activities; (iv)
          in accordance with Section 4.6(a) (any such suspension will be considered a “Service Suspension”). If Customer
          (including Users) is using the Service in a manner that, in zrzastudio.com’s reasonable judgment, causes or is
          likely to cause significant harm to zrzastudio.com or the Service or otherwise threatens the security,
          integrity or availability of the Service, then zrzastudio.com may suspend Customer’s access to the Service.
          zrzastudio.com will use commercially reasonable efforts under the circumstances of such suspension to (x)
          provide Customer with notice and an opportunity to remedy such violation or threat prior to any such
          suspension; (y) limit the suspension to only Users involved in the activities in question; and (z) remove the
          suspension as quickly as practicable after the circumstances leading to the suspension have been resolved.

          3. Information Security

          Services and Professional Services; (ii) zrzastudio.com will employ reasonable security measures to protect
          Customer Data in accordance with zrzastudio.com’s information security policy as amended by zrzastudio.com
          from time to time (the “Information Security Policy”). Such Information Security Policy will state
          administrative, physical, and technical safeguards designed to protect Customer Data from unauthorized access,
          acquisition, or disclosure, destruction, alteration, accidental loss, misuse, or damage that are no less
          rigorous than generally accepted industry practices and will ensure that all such safeguards comply with data
          protection and privacy Laws, as well as the terms and conditions of this Agreement. At a minimum,
          zrzastudio.com’s safeguards for the protection of Customer Data will include: (a) limiting access of Customer
          Data to Customer and zrzastudio.com’s authorized personnel; (b) securing business facilities, data centers,
          paper files, servers, backup systems, and computing equipment, including, but not limited to, all mobile
          devices and other equipment with information storage capability; (c) implementing network, application,
          database, and platform security; (d) securing information transmission, storage, and disposal; (e)
          implementing authentication and access controls within media, applications, operating systems, and equipment;
          (f) encrypting Customer Data transmitted over public or wireless networks; (g) conducting risk assessments,
          penetration testing, and vulnerability scans and promptly implementing, at zrzastudio.com’s sole cost and
          expense, a corrective action plan to correct any issues that are reported as a result of the testing; (h)
          implementing appropriate personnel security and integrity procedures and practices, including, but not limited
          to, conducting background checks consistent with applicable law; and (i) providing appropriate privacy and
          information security training to zrzastudio.com’s employees.
          Data Protection Agreement. If Customer’s use of the Services involves processing personal data pursuant to
          Regulation 2016/679 (the “GDPR”) and/or transferring personally identifiable information outside the European
          Economic Area or Switzerland to any country not deemed by the European Commission as providing an adequate
          level of protection for such information or applicable regulations, the terms of the

          (“DPA”) located at or separately executed DPA will apply.

          4. Fees

          Fees. Customer will pay the fees specified in a Statement of Work or Order Form (“Fees”). Fees for the
          Services are based on Subscriptions purchased during the Term and not actual usage. All Fees are
          non-refundable, except as may be expressly set forth in this Agreement. Customer will make all payments
          hereunder in US dollars.
          Invoicing and Payment. Except as otherwise specified in any Order Form or Statement of Work, all fees and
          charges under this Agreement will be invoiced in advance and are due net thirty (30) days from the date of
          Customer’s receipt of an undisputed the invoice.
          User Re-assignment. Customer may reassign Subscriptions from time to time to new Users who replace former
          Users who no longer use or need access to the Service. Customer, however, may not allow more than one
          individual User to use or otherwise share a single Subscription.
          Adding Users. Users that are given administrative permission by Customer may add new Users at any time through
          the Service. Upon adding additional User(s), zrzastudio.com will contact Customer in writing to discuss
          Customer’s options. Customer will have thirty (30) days after receipt of zrzastudio.com’s written notice to
          Customer regarding the over-deployment to either (a) purchase a pro-rata subscription for such User(s) at the
          same price stated on the applicable, then-current Order Form by executing a new Order Form with
          zrzastudio.com, or (b) discontinue use of the over-deployed User seats. If, within such thirty (30) day
          period, Customer does not either execute a new Order Form for such additional Users or discontinue use of
          over-deployed User seats, Customer will be invoiced the current list price for those Users for the remainder
          of the then-current Subscription Period and be required to pay such invoices in accordance with this
          Agreement. As zrzastudio.com is a subscription services provider, the number of Users purchased under an Order
          Form cannot be decreased during the term of such Order Form.
          Fees for Third-Party Services. Customer is responsible for all fees charged by its Customer Third-Party
          Services. If Customer requires zrzastudio.com to submit invoices or billing statements through a system
          designated by the Customer ("Invoicing Portal"), the Customer shall be responsible for all fees, costs, and
          expenses directly associated with the use of such Invoicing Portal.
          Failure to Pay. If Customer fails to pay any undisputed invoices in accordance with this section,
          zrzastudio.com may, after providing Customer written notice of such non-payment and giving ten (10) days from
          the date of such notice to remit the overdue, undisputed amounts in full, take the following actions: (a)
          suspend Customer’s access to the Service pending payment of such overdue invoices; and (b) charge a finance
          fee of 1.5% per month on any outstanding balance, or the maximum permitted by law, whichever is lower. If
          Customer believes that zrzastudio.com has billed them incorrectly, Customer must notify zrzastudio.com no
          later than sixty (60) days after the closing date on the first billing statement in which the error or problem
          appeared to receive an adjustment or credit. Once zrzastudio.com receives notice of a disputed invoice,
          zrzastudio.com will review such notice and provide Customer with a written decision regarding the dispute,
          including documentary support for such decision. If zrzastudio.com reasonably determines that the amounts
          charged on a disputed invoice are, in fact, due, Customer will pay such amounts within ten (10) days of
          zrzastudio.com notifying Customer in writing of such decision. Additionally, Customer will be responsible for
          any fees associated with sending their account to collections, which shall also include, but is not limited
          to, any applicable attorney’s fees and court costs.
          Taxes. All Fees and other amounts payable by Customer under this Agreement are exclusive of taxes and similar
          assessments. Customer is responsible for all sales, use, and excise taxes, and any other similar taxes,
          duties, and charges of any kind imposed by any federal, state, or local governmental or regulatory authority
          on any amounts payable by Customer hereunder, other than any taxes imposed on zrzastudio.com’s income,
          personnel, property, or other assets, or similar taxes not directly based on Customer’s use or consumption of
          zrzastudio.com’s products and services.
          Subscriptions Through Resellers. If Customer purchases Subscriptions through a resale partner authorized by
          zrzastudio.com to resell such Subscriptions (“Reseller”), Customer will make all payments in accordance with
          the Order Form with the Reseller or zrzastudio.com. Reseller may offer different prices or different or
          additional terms and conditions for use of the Services than made available by zrzastudio.com. Any such
          different or additional terms and conditions (including any additional warranties) are between Customer and
          Reseller and zrzastudio.com assumes no responsibility for such terms. Customer understands and agrees that if
          Customer does not pay the Reseller in accordance with the applicable Order Form, zrzastudio.com will have the
          right to suspend Customer’s right to use and access the Service and to terminate this Agreement upon notice to
          Customer.”

          extent that such Losses arise out of or result from a claim that any of the Services or any zrzastudio.com
          Materials actually does or threatens to infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate any United States’
          Intellectual Property Right, provided however, that zrzastudio.com will have no liability or obligation for
          any Action or Losses to the extent that such Action or Losses arise out of or results from any: (a) alteration
          or modification of the Services or the zrzastudio.com Materials without zrzastudio.com’s express written
          authorization; (b) use of the Services or the zrzastudio.com Materials by Customer or a User pursuant to this

          approved by or on behalf of zrzastudio.com in writing; (c) access to or use of the Services or the
          zrzastudio.com Materials that is expressly prohibited by this Agreement or otherwise outside the scope of
          access or manner or purpose of use described or contemplated anywhere in this Agreement, the Documentation or
          the applicable Order Form; (d) any Customer Data or any instruction or information provided by Customer to
          zrzastudio.com and used in accordance with this Agreement; (e) violation of any applicable Law by Customer or
          any of its Users.
          Options. Subject to the exclusions set forth in subsection (a) through (e) of Section 8.1, if zrzastudio.com
          reasonable believes that any of the Services or the zrzastudio.com Materials infringe or otherwise violate the
          rights of any third-party, zrzastudio.com will either, at zrzastudio.com’s sole cost and expense: (i) procure
          for Customer the right to continue to access and use the Services and zrzastudio.com Materials to the full
          extent contemplated by this Agreement and the Documentation; or (ii) modify or replace the Services or
          zrzastudio.com Materials that infringe or are alleged to infringe to make the Services or zrzastudio.com
          Materials non-infringing while providing substantially equivalent features and functionality. If
          zrzastudio.com reasonably determines that the foregoing remedies would be commercially impractical or
          impossible then zrzastudio.com will terminate this Agreement and promptly provide Customer with a pro-rata
          refund any prepaid Fees for the unused Services.
          Indemnification by Customer. Customer will indemnify and defend zrzastudio.com and zrzastudio.com’s Affiliates
          from and against any and all Losses incurred by zrzastudio.com or zrzastudio.com’s Affiliates resulting from

          or are alleged to arise out of or result from any act, omission, or other matter described in subclause (a)
          through subclause (e) of Section 8.1, whether or not the same results in any Action or Losses by
          zrzastudio.com; or (ii) a claim that Customer or Customer Data, actually does or threatens to infringe,
          misappropriate, or otherwise violate any United States’ Intellectual Property Right or other right of a
          third-party.
          Procedure. Each Party’s obligations under Sections 8.1 and 8.3 are conditioned on the indemnified Party (a)
          providing the indemnifying Party with prompt written notice of the Action (provided that the indemnified
          Party’s failure to provide such written notice will only relieve the indemnifying Party of its indemnification
          obligations hereunder to the extent such failure materially limits or prejudices the indemnifying Party’s
          ability to defend or settle such Action), (b) granting the indemnifying Party the sole control of the defense
          and settlement of the Action, and (c) providing reasonable information and assistance to the indemnifying
          Party in the defense or settlement of the Action at the indemnifying Party’s expense. Notwithstanding anything
          else to the contrary in this Agreement, any obligation of the indemnifying Party to defend, indemnify and hold
          the indemnified Party harmless hereunder is limited to the indemnifying Party’s payment for the cost of
          defense of the third-party claim incurred by the indemnifying Party and the payment of (i) any settlements
          agreed to by indemnifying Party in a writing signed by an officer of indemnifying Party, or (ii) final
          judgments awarded to the third-party claimant by a court of competent jurisdiction. The indemnifying Party
          will not agree to any settlement of any Action that requires the indemnified Party to make any admission of
          wrongdoing or to pay any amounts not covered by the indemnifying Party without the indemnified Party’s prior
          written consent. Any indemnitee may participate in and observe the proceedings at its own cost and expense
          with counsel of its own choosing.
          Sole Remedy. THIS SECTION 8 SETS FORTH CUSTOMER’S SOLE REMEDIES AND zrzastudio.com’S SOLE LIABILITY AND
          OBLIGATION FOR ANY ACTUAL, THREATENED, OR ALLEGED CLAIMS THAT THE SERVICES OR zrzastudio.com MATERIALS
          INFRINGE, MISAPPROPRIATE, OR OTHERWISE VIOLATE ANY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF ANY THIRD PARTY.

          OTHERWISE) UPON WHICH THE CLAIM IS BASED.
          Exceptions. The exclusions and limitations in Section 9.1 will not apply to: (a) a Party’s indemnification
          obligations under Section 8; or (b) Customer’s breach of Section 4 or Section 5.3. Notwithstanding the
          foregoing, zrzastudio.com’s aggregate liability arising out of or related to a material breach of Section 3 of

          that has been pre-paid and is subject to the material breach. Termination of this Agreement by zrzastudio.com

          obligations nor liability of any type with respect to the services for the Free Services unless such exclusion

          the Free Services will not exceed $1,000.00. Without limiting the foregoing, zrzastudio.com and its Affiliates

          damages are not an adequate remedy. Such remedies are not exclusive and are in addition to all other remedies
          that may be available at law, in equity or otherwise.

          where required under applicable law or in reliance on our legitimate interests to:

          Maintain high-quality sales calls, demos and engagements with prospects and customers
          Provide training and coaching to our sales teams
          Generate automated call transcripts
          Keep our records up to date (for example, in relation to follow-up meetings, sales opportunities, and updating
          customer contact details)
          Improve our sales processes and make our sales calls and product demos more impactful



          We also collect certain information related to your use of our websites. In some jurisdictions in the United
          States and countries in the EEA, the UK, and Switzerland, this information may be considered personal data
          under applicable data protection laws. We may combine this information with personal information provided by
          you. In particular, we collect the following personal information from you automatically:



          When you access our websites or content. When you visit our websites, we collect information about your device
          and your usage. The information collected may include your IP address, device type, unique device
          identification numbers, browser type, broad geographic location (for example, country or city-level location
          based on your public IP address), performance, and other usage and technical information. We also collect
          information about how you interact with our websites (for example, referring web page, pages visited, features
          used), emails, content, or other features (for example, when you open a marketing email or click on an
          embedded link, or if you watch videos on our site, or interact with/message using our chat function). Some of
          this information may be collected using cookies and similar tracking technology, as further explained in our
          Cookie Notice. We do not collect “sensitive personal information” as the term is defined by California law
          beyond what is necessary to provide your requested services. Accordingly, we do not provide a mechanism for
          you to request that we limit our use of sensitive personal information.



          Purpose and Legal Basis Under Data Protection Law: We process your personal information in reliance on our
          legitimate interests to:
          Better understand the visitors who come to our websites, where they come from, and what content on our website
          is of interest to them. We use this information for our internal analytics purposes and to improve the quality
          and relevance of our websites to our visitors.
          Provide, operate, and maintain our websites, including providing access to content you have requested and
          displaying country-specific information.
          Protect the security and prevent misuse of our websites and services by tracking use of our websites and
          services, verifying accounts and activity, investigating suspicious activity, and enforcing our terms and
          policies.



          When you use the zrzastudio mobile application. When you use our mobile app, we collect certain information
          from your device such as your device make, model, and memory. Our application will assign a unique identifier
          to your device to help us improve the performance of our applications. zrzastudio does not use information
          collected from our mobile app for targeted advertising.



          Purpose and Legal Basis Under Data Protection Law: We process your personal information in reliance on our
          legitimate interests to:
          Detect crashes, undertake troubleshooting, and understand and improve end-user experience with our mobile
          applications
          Remotely enable or disable features within the mobile application



          If you are an end user of a zrzastudio product through a zrzastudio customer. When you use our products and
          services through your employer or another zrzastudio customer (for example, when using a zrzastudio enterprise
          cloud application), we log certain systems usage information automatically. This information may include
          system-generated identifiers such as IP address, operating system type and version, whether service tasks and
          notifications complete, date and time stamps, and details about which of our products you are using. We do not
          identify you from this systems usage information unless your organization first provides us with instructions
          to do so, and provides us with certain information about your end-user account. This may happen in the context
          of a customer support request (e.g., when you or your organization ask us to help you resolve an issue you are
          having with our products and services).



          Purpose and Legal Basis Under Data Protection Law: To the extent our systems usage information is treated as
          “personal information” under applicable data protection laws, we process this personal information in reliance
          on our legitimate interests to:
          Provide and maintain the functionality of services and products you and/or your organization request
          Assess and analyze your (and your organization’s) experience interacting with zrzastudio’s services
          Undertake research and development in light of this assessment in order to improve performance of the services
          Protect the security and prevent misuse of our services by investigating suspicious activity and enforcing our
          terms and policies



          zrzastudio may share or make accessible your personal information to third parties as follows:



          zrzastudio Affiliates. zrzastudio may disclose any of the categories of personal information described above
          to affiliates within the zrzastudio group where necessary to fulfill a request you have submitted or for
          customer support, marketing, technical operations, event registration, and account management purposes.



          Service providers. zrzastudio may disclose the categories of personal information described above to
          third-party service providers or vendors contracted to provide services on our behalf (for example, IT and
          hosting, data analytics, event services, customer support, call recording, chatbot technology, data
          enrichment, email fulfillment, and payment services). These third-party service providers may use personal
          information we provide to them only as instructed by zrzastudio.



          Event Sponsors. When you participate in webinars, events, and other activities where zrzastudio collaborates
          with third parties, we may disclose the information described under “if you register for events and webinars”
          above, such as your contact information and interests in these offerings or services to these approved third
          parties to communicate with you.



          zrzastudio partners. zrzastudio may share your personal information with certain partners that offer
          supplementary services to those provided by zrzastudio, such as partners that resell zrzastudio services, to
          the extent you consent to such sharing (where required by applicable law) or direct us to intentionally
          interact with such third parties.



          Your organization. Where your organization is a customer or potential customer of zrzastudio, we may disclose
          your personal information to relevant people within your organization. For example, we may share a list of
          individuals attending a zrzastudio event, information about zrzastudio Training courses you have completed, or
          inquiries from end users that should be addressed directly by the organization rather than zrzastudio.



          Advertising. When you visit our website, we may enable third parties to use cookies and other trackers to show
          you ads on third-party websites that are more relevant to you. Under some data protection laws, our disclosure
          of this information to third parties through cookies and other trackers for targeted advertising may be
          considered a “sale” or “share” of personal information. Please see our Cookie Notice for more information
          about the types of cookies we use or click “Cookie Preferences” (link located in the footer of our Website) to
          set your preferences and opt-out of the sale or sharing (for targeted advertising) of your data. zrzastudio
          does not have actual knowledge that it “sells” or “shares” the personal information of individuals under 16
          years of age.



          Additional disclosures: zrzastudio may disclose data if we have a good-faith belief that such action is
          necessary to (a) conform to legal requirements or comply with legal processes; (b) protect and defend our
          rights or property; (c) enforce our website Terms and Conditions; and/or (d) act to protect the interests of
          our customers, users, or others. If zrzastudio goes through a business transition, such as a merger,
          acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, your personal information may be
          among the assets transferred, provided that we inform the actual or potential buyer (or its agents and
          advisors) that it must use your personal information only for the purposes disclosed in this Privacy
          Statement. zrzastudio may also ask for your consent to disclose your information to other unaffiliated third
          parties that are not described elsewhere in this statement.


          We use technical and organizational measures that provide a level of security appropriate to the nature of the
          personal information and the risks that are presented by processing your personal information. However, the
          security of information transmitted through the internet can never be guaranteed. You are responsible for
          maintaining the security of your password or other forms of authentication involved in accessing
          password-protected or secured resources.

          Depending on where you are located and how you interact with zrzastudio, you may have certain legal rights
          over the personal information we hold about you, subject to local privacy laws.



          These may include the right, depending on your jurisdiction, to:



          Obtain access to your personal information that is being processed by us.
          Correct inaccurate personal information.
          Request the deletion of your personal information.
          Opt out of the sale or sharing of personal information for targeted advertising.
          Object to the processing of your personal information carried out on the basis of our legitimate interests in
          the EEA, UK, and Switzerland, and ask us to restrict the processing of your personal information.
          Request the portability of your personal information in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable
          format.
          Withdraw your consent at any time, if we have collected and processed your personal information with your
          consent. Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your
          withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful
          processing grounds other than consent.
          Opt out of marketing communications sent by zrzastudio.
